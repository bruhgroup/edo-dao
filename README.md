The E-DAO is an initiative to revolutionize the landscape of education governance in the classrooms by gamifying experiences. Rooted in blockchain technology and principles of collective ownership, the E-DAO aims to empower students in shaping the future of education.

A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that places decision-making power in the hands of students through gamification. By leveraging blockchain technology, the E-DAO seeks to create a transparent, democratic, and inclusive platform where students can actively participate in shaping the policies, curriculum, and overall direction of their educational experience.

## Main Points
- DECENTRALITY: Edo has the ability to mint and distribute tokens, but is unable to use them.
- INCENTIVE: Students will be awarded governance tokens ($CLK) based on their grades.
- GOVERNANCE: Students can submit Professor Improvement Proposals (EIPs) and vote on them using $CLK.
- FOCUS: The encouragement of learning through “gamification” rewards for academic progress.

## Zero-Knowledge Proofs
Students are able to submit anonymous feedback for the course. Utilizing a Zero Knowledge prove that the submitter is part of the class, all without revealing their true identity.
